# Image Segmentation using OpenCV and K-Means

This repository contains Python code for performing image segmentation using OpenCV and K-Means clustering algorithm.

## Objective
The objective of this project is to segment an input image into different clusters based on the color distribution in the image. 
Image segmentation is a crucial step in various computer vision applications such as object detection, image recognition, and medical imaging.

## Libraries Used
- OpenCV: Open Source Computer Vision Library for image processing tasks.
- NumPy: Numerical computing library for handling multidimensional arrays and matrices.
- Matplotlib: Plotting library for creating visualizations in Python.

## What's Included
- `image_segmentation.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the code for image segmentation using K-Means clustering.
- `butterfly.jpg`: Sample input image used for image segmentation.
- `README.md`: Readme file providing an overview of the project and usage instructions.

## Overview of steps performed
- The script demonstrates the process of image segmentation using the K-Means clustering algorithm.
- It includes visualization of color clusters in 3D space and segmented image output.
- Optimization of the value of K (number of clusters) is performed using the elbow method.
